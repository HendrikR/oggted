First make sure that taglib is installed.
Otherwise, check if your system offers a binary and/or devel package for it.
If it does not, download taglib from here:
    http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib/
and then build and install it.

Use the following commands to build and install oggted:

    $ make
    # make install

Please notice, that the second command needs root priveleges.

The default prefix for the installation is /usr/local. Replace the second
command with the following, to use a directory of your choice:

    # make PREFIX=/your/install/path install

The default Makefile should work on almost any *NIX system.
Please make sure that the CXXFLAGS variable contains "-I" entries for the
include directory of taglib. The LDFLAGS variable has to contain "-L" entries
for the lib directory of taglib.  Please have a look at the gcc manpage for
more details.

All build-time specific settings are set via preprocessor macros in the file
"config.h". Please check and change them, so that they fit your needs.

After the installation you can type "oggted --help" for getting information
on how to use it.
